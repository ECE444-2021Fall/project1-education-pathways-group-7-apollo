<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The objective of this application is to create an informative UX-friendly tool for post-secondary
students to make course selection decisions. It will allow students to better plan their schedules
and progress towards their degree and any minors/certifications. In addition, students will have
an easier time finding new courses by improving current tools through better design and
features.
